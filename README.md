# Weather_app-Prodigy-Task
This project was developed as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy. The goal of this task was to design and implement a fully functional weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is lightweight, responsive, and beginner-friendly, making it easy to understand and deploy.
